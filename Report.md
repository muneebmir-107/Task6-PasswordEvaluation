# üìù Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Task Overview
This task involved creating multiple passwords of varying complexity and analyzing their strength using online password evaluation tools. The aim was to understand what makes a password secure and how to protect against common attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.

## Password List and Analysis

| Password         | Strength         | Time to Crack         | Feedback                           |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| password123      | Weak             | < 1 second            | Common and predictable             |
| ilovecoffee      | Weak             | < 5 seconds           | No variety, only lowercase letters |
| QwErTy123        | Moderate         | 3 hours               | Predictable pattern                |
| P@ssw0rd2025!    | Strong           | 2 years               | Good mix of characters and length  |
| A!9x#LzT@q6      | Very Strong      | 10^34 years           | Random, long, and complex          |

## What Makes a Password Strong?
- At least 12 characters long
- Includes uppercase and lowercase letters
- Contains numbers and special characters
- Avoids dictionary words or predictable sequences
- Randomized, non-repetitive characters

## Best Practices
- Use a password manager for storage and creation.
- Don‚Äôt reuse the same password across websites.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra protection.
- Prefer random strings or passphrases over common words.

## Common Attacks on Passwords
### Brute Force Attack
- Attempts every possible combination until the correct one is found.
- Easily defeated by long and complex passwords.

### Dictionary Attack
- Uses precompiled lists of common passwords and words.
- Fails against randomized passwords or passphrases.

## Final Thoughts
Password security is a foundational skill in cybersecurity. Weak passwords remain one of the top causes of security breaches. This task highlighted how small changes in password composition drastically improve resistance to attacks.
