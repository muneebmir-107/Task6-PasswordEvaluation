#  Cyber Security Internship â€“ Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

##  Task Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test multiple passwords using online password strength tools.

##  Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)

##  Task Steps
1. Created 5 passwords with varying complexity.
2. Evaluated them using password strength checkers.
3. Collected scores, feedback, and estimated cracking time.
4. Identified best practices for strong passwords.
5. Studied brute force and dictionary attacks.
6. Summarized findings in a report.

##  Password Strength Evaluation Table

| Password         | Strength Rating | Time to Crack        | Feedback                          |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| password123      | Weak             | < 1 second            | Common, predictable, lacks symbols |
| ilovecoffee      | Weak             | < 5 seconds           | Only lowercase letters, short      |
| QwErTy123        | Moderate         | 3 hours               | Keyboard pattern, partially strong |
| P@ssw0rd2025!    | Strong           | 2 billion years       | Good length, complexity, symbols   |
| A!9x#LzT@q6      | Very Strong      | 10^34 years           | Excellent strength and randomness  |

##  Key Learnings
- Use long passwords (12+ characters).
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words and common phrases.
- Never reuse passwords.
- Consider using passphrases or a password manager.

##  Password Attacks Summary
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries every possible combination. Time-consuming for long, complex passwords.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Tries common words/phrases. Easily defeats weak passwords with dictionary words.

## Conclusion
Password strength directly impacts your resistance to cyber attacks. A good password is complex, long, and unique. Using strong password practices is essential for secure digital life.
